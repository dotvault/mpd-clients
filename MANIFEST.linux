## Music Player

## Requirements:
## - Deamon: mpd
## - CLI: mpc
## - Clients:
##     - ncmpcpp
##     - rmpc


## NOTE: My configuration is set up to run with user permissions by default,
##  which means no permission changes are required to use it.
##
## Only enable the user service
## system --user enable --now mpd.service
##
## mpd (Deamon)
mpd      | | mpd/playlists | exclude | .config
mpd      | | mpd/          | copy    | .config


## NOTE: MPD also needs audio backends, such as PipeWire or ALSA. You need to install them.
## These packages's default configuration works out of the box.
## Here are some of my personal settings for reference.
##
## pipewire (Audio backend)


## NOTE: MPD' clients
## Although I minimized hardcoding so it works without changes, some settings had to be hardcoded.
## Because they can't read environment variables or for other reasons — you should check them to ensure they work on your device.
##
## ncmpcpp (MPD TUI client)
ncmpcpp  | | ncmpcpp/error.log | exclude | .config
ncmpcpp  | | ncmpcpp/          | copy    | .config


## WARNING: hardcode
##
## rmpc (MPD TUI client)
rmpc     | | rmpc/bin/onresize | exclude | .config
rmpc     | | rmpc/             | copy    | .config
